## 🏥 Overview

**MediTrack** is a comprehensive personal health tracking and medication management application designed for individuals managing chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or post-surgery recovery. The app serves as a digital health diary, enabling users to log daily vitals, set medicine reminders, record symptoms, and build a health history that can be shared with doctors in a clean PDF format.

> **Note:** MediTrack is not a diagnostic tool but a consistent tracking companion that helps patients stay on top of their health routine.
